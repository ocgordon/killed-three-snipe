# killed-three-snipe

## 28 August

I'm 24, but have still done nothing. I feel that it's not for nothing that I've been struggling with
doubts and passions for eight years now. But what am I destined for? The future will disclose.
Killed three snipe.

## What is this?

A silly Chrome extension to add "Killed three snipe." to the end of tweets in honor of Leo Tolstoy's
24 year-old existentsial crisis. Why would you want this? Why would you _not_ want this? Live your
life, kill three snipe. What is this app destined for? The future will disclose.

## Status

In-progress.
